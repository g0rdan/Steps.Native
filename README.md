# Steps.Native

I'm Xamarin developer more than 4 years now. Mostly, I've been developing for Xamarin Native/Classic.
So, I do know platforms APIs pretty well, but I haven't actually develop anything from native side of platforms (iOS/Android).
I had some experiance but I haven't finished any complete app as native app.
So, I've decided to fill that gap and I want to try to write two native apps on Swift and Kotlin with same functionality.
The purpose of it is to feel "is it worth?" to write native apps and second, it's increasing knowledge about languages/platforms/technics.

So, the app will be the simplest fitness app with following functionality:

- count steps
- show dayly steps / weekly history
- work with network (should figure out what exactly has to do)

I'll try to make UI app's design simmilar to Activity app on iOS.

As I said, I want to wear "native developer's shoes", so I'm going to use most
common/popular technics/libs/ways to create the app. For example:

- Architecture: MVC for iOS, MVP for Android
- Storages: Core Data for iOS, most popular storage lib for Android.
- Network: native http clients for both platforms, native ways to work with JSON (if needed)
- UI: take platform's design principels for each platform.
